Wireless is wonderful, but sometimes you want the strong reliability of a wire. If your Feather board is going to be part of a permanent installation, this Ethernet FeatherWing will let you add quick and easy wired Internet. Just plug in a standard ethernet cable, and run the Ethernet2 library for cross-platform networking. Works with all/any of our Feather boards as an Ethernet Client (server not supported at this time)!

Ethernet is a tried-and-true networking standard. It's supported by every hub and switch, and because there's a physical connection you don't have to noodle around with SSIDs, passwords, authentication schemes or antennas. It works great with any of our Feathers, the WIZ5500 chip communicates over SPI plus a single CS pin. The Arduino Ethernet2 library works great, and within a few seconds after connecting, will do the DHCP setup for you. As a nice extra, the RJ-45 jack has both link and activity lights that will light/blink to let you know the current connection status.
